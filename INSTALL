You have to compile spettro from source at present.


PREPARATION

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you need to:
	# Always
	apt-get install libfftw3-dev pkg-config
	# Default library choices
	apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsndfile-dev

	# If you want to use SDL1.2 instead of SDL2.0
	apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
	# and change sdl2-config to sdl-config in Makefile.am
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION:
	apt-get install e17-dev libecore-dev libemotion-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION_SDL, all of the above.

	# For -DUSE_LIBSOX
	apt-get install libsox-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_LIBAUDIOFILE
	apt-get install libaudiofile-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_LIBAV
	apt-get install libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev

for the build system:
	apt-get install autoconf make

and a compiler of some kind:
	apt-get install build-essential
will do the trick for sure, but
	apt-get install gcc
will probably be enough. Clang also works: configure CC=clang


FETCHING THE SOURCE CODE

	apt-get install git
	git clone git://github.com/martinwguy/spettro
	cd spettro


COMPILATION

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader	# generates configure.h.in
	automake --add-missing
	./configure
	make
or
	sh build.sh


INSTALLATION

	sudo make install	# In /usr/local by default


EXECUTION

	spettro whatever.wav


ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS

To do to graphics and to play the sound, by default it uses SDL 2.0.
It can also use SDL 1.2, which includes a driver for colored ASCII-art,
or use the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries instead, which should run on
Android and iOS and Windows.

To read/decode the audio file, by default it uses libsndfile;
alternatives are libaudiofile, libsox, libavformat (ffmpeg).
None work well. See the file WORKS.

Modify Makefile.am to make these alternative selections.
