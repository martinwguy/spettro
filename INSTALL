You have to compile spettro from source at present.


PREPARATION

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you need to:
	# Always
	apt-get install libfftw3-dev pkg-config

	# For -DUSE_SDL (the default); (See Makefile.am)
	apt-get install libsdl-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION:
	apt-get install e17-dev libecore-dev libemotion-dev

	# For -DUSE_LIBSNDFILE (the default):
	apt-get install libsndfile-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_LIBAUDIOFILE
	apt-get install libaudiofile-dev

and a compiler of some kind:
	apt-get install build-essential
will do the trick for sure, but
	apt-get install gcc make
will probably be enough.


FETCHING THE SOURCE CODE

	apt-get install git
	git clone git://github.com/martinwguy/spettro
	cd spettro


COMPILATION

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader	# generates configure.h.in
	automake --add-missing
	./configure
	make


EXECUTION

	./spettro whatever.wav


ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS

To do to graphics and to play the sound, by default it uses the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries; an alternative is to use SDL for both
or EFL for the graphics and SDL for the sound player.

To read/decode the audio file, by default it uses libsndfile;
an alternative is to use libaudiofile.

See the Makefile for instructions on how to make these alternative selections.
