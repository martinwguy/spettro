You have to compile spettro from source at present.


PREPARATION

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you need to:
	# Always
	apt-get install libfftw3-dev pkg-config
	# Default library choices
	apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsndfile-dev

	# If you want to use SDL1.2 instead of SDL2.0
	apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
	# and change sdl2-config to sdl-config in Makefile.am
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION:
	apt-get install e17-dev libecore-dev libemotion-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION_SDL, all of the above.

	# For -DUSE_LIBSOX
	apt-get install libsox-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_LIBAUDIOFILE
	apt-get install libaudiofile-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_LIBAV
	apt-get install libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev

for the build system:
	apt-get install autoconf make

and a compiler of some kind:
	apt-get install build-essential
will do the trick for sure, but
	apt-get install gcc
will probably be enough. Clang also works: configure CC=clang


FETCHING THE SOURCE CODE

	apt-get install git
	git clone git://github.com/martinwguy/spettro
	cd spettro


COMPILATION

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader	# generates configure.h.in
	automake --add-missing
	./configure
	make
or
	sh build.sh


INSTALLATION

	sudo make install	# In /usr/local by default


EXECUTION

	spettro whatever.wav


ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS

To do to graphics and to play the sound, by default it uses the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries; an alternative is to use SDL for both
or EFL for the graphics and SDL for the sound player.

To read/decode the audio file, by default it uses libsox;
alternatives are libaudiofile, libsndfile, libavformat (ffmpeg).

Modify Makefile.am to make these alternative selections.
