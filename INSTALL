# You have to compile spettro from source at present.

# Here are the Debian/Ubuntu/Mint runes, which you can also run
# by saying "sh INSTALL".


# PREPARATION

# On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you need to:
	# Always
	sudo apt-get install -y libfftw3-dev pkg-config

	# Default library choices
	sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev libsndfile-dev libmpg123-dev

	# If you want to use SDL1.2 instead of SDL2.0
	# change sdl2-config to sdl-config in Makefile.am and
	sudo apt-get install -y libsdl1.2-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION:
	sudo apt-get install -y libemotion-dev
	# or, for -DUSE_EMOTION_SDL, both of these.

# for the build system:
	sudo apt-get install -y autoconf make

# and a compiler of some kind:
	sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
# will do the trick for sure, but
	# sudo apt-get install -y gcc
# will probably be enough. Clang also works: ./configure CC=clang


# FETCHING THE SOURCE CODE

if false; then	# If running as a shell script, you've already fetched it
	sudo apt-get install -y git
	git clone git://github.com/martinwguy/spettro
	cd spettro
fi


# COMPILATION

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader	# generates configure.h.in
	automake --add-missing
	./configure
	make
# or, to check that every combination of libraries compiles OK,
	# s/check_builds


# INSTALLATION

	sudo make install	# In /usr/local by default
# or
	# apt-get install -y debhelper
	# dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -B
	# dpkg -i ../spettro*deb

exit	# end of shell-scriptable part

EXECUTION

	spettro whatever.wav


ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS

To do to graphics and to play the sound, by default it uses SDL 2.0.
It can also use SDL 1.2, which includes a driver for colored ASCII-art,
or use the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries instead, which should also
run on Android, iOS and Windows.

Modify Makefile.am to make these alternative selections.
One day we'll have ./configure --with-emotion and so on.
