You have to compile spettro from source at present.


PREPARATION

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you need to:
	apt-get install e17-dev libecore-dev libemotion-dev libsdl-dev
	apt-get install libsndfile-dev	# or libaudiofile-dev - See Makefile
	apt-get install libfftw3-dev libsdl-dev pkg-config

and a compiler of some kind:
	apt-get install build-essential
will do the trick for sure, but
	apt-get install gcc make
will probably be enough.


FETCHING THE SOURCE CODE

	apt-get install git
	git clone git://github.com/martinwguy/spettro
	cd spettro


COMPILATION

	aclocal
	autoconf
	automake --add-missing
	./configure
	make


EXECUTION

	./spettro whatever.wav


ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS

To do to graphics and to play the sound, by default it uses the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries; an alternative is to use SDL for both
or EFL for the graphics and SDL for the sound player.

To read/decode the audio file, by default it uses libsndfile;
an alternative is to use libaudiofile.

See the Makefile for instructions on how to make these alternative selections.
