Which audio file-reading libraries work with which file format types?
1) Does it try to read it?  -- means no, for the others see the Legend.
2) Does it get the native-endian 16-bit short audio data right for playing?
   a) From mono files?  b) From stereo files (-2)?
3) Does it get the mono-double audio data right for display?

== Legend ==
--: Doesn't even try to read the file
OK: Looks or sounds right
GAPS: The audio is like a dotted line
UP: The same but at twice the correct frequency
OFFSET: The display starts with 15 seconds of black before the spectral data.
JUMP: The audio is silent and playing skips immediately to end-of-file.
	Stereo: you can seek in the file and play the displayed part, hearing it
	at the correct speed but lumpily at twice the frequency.
REPEAT: Repeats the first 8.5 seconds three times. 
LAGGY:	Once decoded, plays OK at first, then gets progressively more gappy.
HALF: The video output is half its normal width but at the right frequency.
      There are a few pixel columns of black at the start.
      Pressins Space jumps to the end of the piece (or the end of the black
      second half) but you can seek back in the file to hear it lumpily at
      the right frequency but twice the speed (half the samples are missing)
      In stereo, it's twice the speed and twice the frequency.
BLOCKY: Looks right vertically but 5 or 6 adjacent pixel columns are the same.
	Audio corresponds: the audio spectrum only changes 4 times a second.
	From a stereo file, the same but the audio is also twice the frequency.
