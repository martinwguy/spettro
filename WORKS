Which audio file-reading libraries work with which file format types?
1) Does it try to read it?  -- means no, for the others see the Legend.
2) Does it get the native-endian 16-bit short audio data right for playing?
   a) From mono files?  b) From stereo files (-2)?
3) Does it get the mono-double audio data right for display?

    Decodes very slowly and the audio is jumpy due to audio file locking.

Doors - Riders on the Storm
    Looks OK, but seeking ahead it clags saying

Dream Warriors - My Definition
    Works but playing the end of the file it says:
    Error: Failed to find valid MPEG data within limit on resync. (code 28)
