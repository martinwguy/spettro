<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SPETTRO</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Visualise music as it plays</P>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="screenshot.png" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Spettro plays a sound file and displays a scrolling
log-frequency-axis as it plays.
<P>
"Normal" spectrograms usually have a linear frequency axis,
which means that the top half of the graphic represents the
top octave of the sound, the next octave down occupies
the next quarter of the screen and so on, leaving all the musical
information crushed into the bottom few lines.
<P>
Spettro is different. With its logarithmic frequency axis, every
octave occupies the same amount of space, spreading the musical
information out evenly in the same way as in conventional musical 
score notation.
<H2>Usage</H2>
To use it, you launch it from the command line with the audio file name
as its argument, press the space bar to start it playing, pause it,
or carry on playing it. When it gets to the end of the piece it stops,
and pressing Space again to start again from the beginning.
<H2>Keyboard comands</H2>
<H3>Keys to position the graphic</H3>
<DL>
 <DT>&larr; &rarr;
  <DD>Left arrow skips back one second in the audio file.
      If you hold down one of the Shift keys and press Left arrow,
      It skips back 10 seconds, or if you hold down Control, it
      skips back by one screen pixel.
  <BR>Right arrow works similarly but skips forward in time instead of back.
 <DT>Home End
  <DD>Home moves you to the start of the piece, End to the end.
 <DT>&uarr; &darr;
  <DD>Up arrow pans moves you up the frequency axis by a whole tone,
      moving the graphic down; down arrow pans down, revealing
      more of the bass frequencies. If Shift is held down, the view pans by
      an octave instead of a tone; if Ctrl is held, it pans by one pixel.
 <DT>x X
  <DD>Pressing a lower case 'x' zooms out by a factor of two on the time
      axis, so that twice as much of the audio becomes visible; upper case
      'X' zooms in, enlarging the central half of the display to fit the
      whole window.
 <DT>y Y
  <DD>Similarly, 'y' zooms out on the frequency axis,
      showing twice the frequency range as before and compressing
      the graphic in the vertical direction; 'Y' zooms in by a factor of
      two so that what was the central half of the graphic now fills the
      whole height.
 <DT>+ -
  <DD>Either of the Plus keys zooms in on both axes, like X and Y
      simultaneously, and the Minus keys zoom out in both directions.
</DL>

<H3>Brightness, contrast and focus</H3>

<DL>
 <DT>* /
  <DD>Star and slash adjust the dynamic range of the color values and act
      like a contrast control.
      The Star key increases the dynamic range by 6dB
      brightening the darker areas to reveal detail,
      and the Slash key decreases the dynamic range by 6dB,
      darkening the graphic to hide noise and make the main events stand out.
      <BR>
      The loudest moments in any piece are always shown at maximum brightness
      (white) and by changing the dynamic range, you change which sound energy
      value is represented by the dimmest color.
 <DT>f F
  <DD>These keys change the FFT size to improve vertical or horizontal focus.
      'f' halves it, improving time resolution, and 'F' doubles it, improving
      frequency resolution.
      <BR>
      The FFT size determines the length of the audio sample used to
      create each column of pixels.
      The starting value is 1/5th of a second, which resolves frequencies
      with a resolution of 5Hz and clearly shows about five musical events
      per second.
      <BR>
      Larger values resolve frequencies more finely but time more coarsely,
      improving the vertical "focus" but smearing it horizontally,
      while smaller values give crisper time definition at the price of
      fuzzier frequency definition.
      <BR>You can also set the initial FFT frequency with the <B>-f</B> flag.
 <DT>t
  <DD>The 't' key show the current playing time on stdout.
 <DT>r
  <DD>The 'r' key redraws the display, in case it got confused.
</DL>

<H3>Frequency markers</H3>

Spettro can overlay the graphic with various sets of horizontal lines:
piano keys, staff lines and guitar strings.

<DL>
 <DT>k
  <DD>The 'k' key (or the <B>-k</B> command-line flag)
      overlays the spectrogram with 88 horizontal lines,
      some black, some white, showing the frequencies of the keys
      of a grand piano from A0(27.5Hz) to C8(4186Hz).
      <BR>Pressing 'k' again removes the keyboard overlay.
 <DT>s
  <DD>The 's' key (or the <B>-s</B> command-line flag)
      overlays two five-line pentagrams, as used in
      manuscript, making it look more like a conventional musical score.
      <BR>From top to bottom, the score lines are centred at:
      <BR>F5(698.5Hz) D5(587.3Hz) B4(493.9Hz) G4(392.0Hz) E4(329.6Hz)
      <BR>A3(220.0Hz) F3(174.6Hz) D3(146.8Hz) B2(123.5Hz) G2(98.0Hz) 
      <BR>Pressing 's' again removes the score lines.
 <DT>g
  <DD>The 'g' key (or the <B>-g</B> command-line flag)
      overlays the frequencies of the six strings
      of the classical guitar, centred at:
      <BR>E2(82.4Hz) A2(110Hz) D3(146.8Hz) G3(196.0Hz) B3(246.9Hz) E4 (329.6Hz)
      <BR>Pressing 'g' again removes them.
</DL>
While piano key lines are one pixel thick, staff lines and guitar lines
are both three pixels thick.
<P>
Only one of Staff and Guitar lines displays at a time (because they overlap)
but you can display the piano keys together with either of them
to identify notes above the top score line or to see the fretted
positions of the guitar strings.

<H4>Bar line indicators</H4>

To help you pick out the rhythm, you can overlay evenly-spaced vertical white
lines on the graphic to show where each bar (or beat) begins.
<P>
To do this, you mark two pixel columns to say where some bar
starts and ends.
When you set the first of the two bar line markers, a single vertical
line appears at that position you marked and when you set the other one,
bar lines appear at that position and evenly throughout the piece.
<P>
There are three ways to mark the bar line positions:
<UL>
 <LI>The command-line flags <B>-l</B> and <B>-r</B> set the left and right
     bar line position, measured in seconds from the start of the piece.
 <LI>You can position the graphic so that the green line is at the start of a
     bar, press 'l' or '[', move it to the end of the bar and press 'r' or ']'.
     For more precise positioning, zoom in on the time axis with 'X' and use
     Control-Leftarrow and Control-Rightarrow to shift the graphic by one pixel
     at a time.
 <LI>If you hold down Control, you can position the left bar line by clicking
     the left mouse button and the right bar line by clicking the right button.
</UL>
You can also set the "left" marker to the right of the "right" marker
and it still works.

you position the graphic so that the central green line
is at the start of one bar, and press '[', then move right until the
green line is at the start of the following bar and press ']'. Evenly-spaced
bar lines will appear throughout the piece.
<BR>To position the bar lines precisely in time with the music,
you can zoom in on the start of a bar using 'X', then hold down the 'Ctrl' key
and use the Left and Right arrow keys to scroll the graphic by a single pixel.
<DL>
 <DT>[
  <DD>Open square bracket marks the start (left side) of a bar.
 <DT>]
  <DD>Close square bracket marks the end (right side) of a bar
      (or the start of the following bar, as you prefer to see it.)
</DL>

<H3>Command-line arguments</H3>

On spettro's command line you can supply various option flags before the
audio file name:
<DL>
 <DT>-a
  <DD>Autoplay the file when the program starts up
 <DT>-e
  <DD>Exit when the audio file has finished playing
 <DT>-f
  <DD>Set the FFT frequency in Hz. Default: 5 (one fifth of a second)
 <DT>-h n
  <DD>Set spectrogram display height to n pixels
 <DT>-w n
  <DD>Set spectrogram display width to n pixels
 <DT>-j n
  <DD>Set maximum number of threads to use (default: the number of CPUs)
 <DT>-k
  <DD>Overlay black and white lines showing where 88-note piano keys are
 <DT>-s
  <DD>Overlay the conventional score notation pentagrams
 <DT>-g
  <DD>Overlay lines showing the positions of a classical guitar's strings
 <DT>-v
  <DD>Print the version of spettro that you're using
 <DT>--help
  <DD>Show a summary of all option flags, keys and environment variables.
</DL>
If no filename is supplied, it opens "audio.wav"

<H3>Environment variables</H3>

You can also tune some of spettro's internal parameters by setting environment
variables on the command line, for example
<BLOCKQUOTE>
PPSEC=100&nbsp;&nbsp;spettro"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
 <DT>PPSEC
  <DD>Pixel columns per second, default 25
 <DT>DYN_RANGE
  <DD>Dynamic range of amplitude values in decibels, default=100
 <DT>MIN_FREQ
  <DD>The frequency centred on the bottom pixel row, currently 27.5 (A1)
 <DT>MAX_FREQ
  <DD>The frequency centred on the top pixel row, currently 14080 (A9)
</DL>

<H3>Bugs</H3>
<OL>
<LI>
If you zoom in too much (about five 'Y's) the graphic turns upside down
and zooms out (because min_freq > max_freq... and it still works!)
