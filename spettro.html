<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SPETTRO</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Visualise music as it plays</P>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="screenshot.png" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Spettro plays a sound file and displays a scrolling
log-frequency-axis as it plays.
<P>
"Normal" spectrograms usually have a linear frequency axis,
which means that the top half of the graphic represents the
top octave of the sound, the next octave down occupies
the next quarter of the screen and so on, leaving all the musical
information crushed into the bottom few lines.
<P>
Spettro is different. With its logarithmic frequency axis, every
octave occupies the same amount of space, spreading the musical
information out evenly in the same way as in conventional musical 
score notation.
<H2>Usage</H2>
To use it, you launch it from the command line with the audio file name
as its argument, press the space bar to start it playing, pause it,
or carry on playing it. When it gets to the end of the piece it stops,
and pressing Space again to start again from the beginning.
<H3>Key strokes to position the graphic</H3>
<DL>
 <DT>&larr; &rarr;
  <DD>Left arrow skips back one second in the audio file.
      If you hold down one of the Shift keys and press Left arrow,
      It skips back 10 seconds, or if you hold down Control, it
      skips back by one screen pixel.
  <BR>Right arrow works similarly but skips forward in time instead of back.
 <DT>&uarr; &darr;
  <DD>Up arrow pans moves you up the frequency axis by a whole tone,
      moving the graphic down; down arrow moves you down, revealing
      more of the bass frequencies. If Shift is held down, they pan by
      an octave instead of a tone; if Ctrl is held, it pans by one pixel
      for extra-precise positioning.
 <DT>x X
  <DD>Pressing a lower case 'x' zooms out by a factor of two on the time
      axis, so that twice as much of the audio becomes visible; upper case
      'X' zooms in, enlarging the central half of the display to fit the
      whole window.
 <DT>y Y
  <DD>Similarly, 'y' zooms out on the frequency axis,
      showing twice the frequency range as before and compressing
      the graphic in the vertical direction; 'Y' zooms in by a factor of
      two so that what was the central half of the graphic now fills the
      whole height.
 <DT>+ -
  <DD>Either of the Plus keys zooms in on both axes, like X and Y
      simultaneously, and the Minus keys zoom out in both directions.
</DL>
<H3>Overlays</H3>
Spettro can overlay the graphic with sets of horizontal and vertical lines,
originally intended to help produce the musical score of a piece for which you
only have the sound.
<H4>Horizontal overlays: staff lines and piano keys</H4>
<DL>
 <DT>s
  <DD>The 's' key makes spettro overlay the graphic with two five-line
      pentagrams used in manuscript score notation, making it look more
      like a conventional musical score.
      <BR>From top to bottom, the score lines are centred at:
      <BR>F5(698.5Hz) D5(587.3Hz) B4(493.9Hz) G4(392.0Hz) E4(329.6Hz)
      <BR>A3(220.0Hz) F3(174.6Hz) D3(146.8Hz) B2(123.5Hz) G2(98.0Hz) 
      <BR>Pressing 's' again removes the score lines.
 <DT>p
  <DD>The 'p' key, instead, overlays the spectrogram with the frequencies
      of all 88 notes of a grand piano's keyboard: the white notes are
      shown as horizontal white lines and the black notes as black lines from
      A0(27.5Hz) to C8(4186Hz).
      <BR>Pressing 'p' again removes the score lines.
</DL>
You can show both of these overlays at the same time: the piano key lines
are a single pixel high, and the staff lines are three pixels thick.

<H4>Vertical overlays: bar lines</H4>

To help score the rhythm, you can overlay vertical lines, evenly spaced in time.
These might correspond to bar lines, or to regular beats in the music.
<BR>To do this, you position the graphic so that the central green line
is at the start of one bar, and press 'l' (Ell), then move right until the
green line is at the start of the following bar and press 'r'. Evenly-spaced
bar lines will appear throughout the piece.
<BR>To have the bar lines in sync with the music, position the bar lines with
precision you can zoom in on the start of a bar using 'X', then use the
Left and Right arrow keys to scroll the graphic by a single pixel.
<DL>
 <DT>l
  <DD>The Ell key marks the start (left side) of a bar.
 <DT>r
  <DD>The 'r' key marks the end (right side) of a bar,
      or the start of the following bar, as you prefer to see it.
