spettro - Show a moving log-frequency axis spectrogram of music while it plays

Here is a program to play an audio file and show a scrolling spectrogram of it
with a vertical green one-pixel-wide line half way across the window to
show the current playing position.

There is also:
- Pan and zoom in time and in frequency range
- A brightness control, made by changing the dynamic range of the colors
- Four FFT window functions: rectangular, Kaiser, Hann and Nuttall
- A variable FFT sample size, changing the relative frequency/time resolution
- Various color maps: heat map, grayscale for screen, grayscale for printer
- Overlays of score staves, open guitar strings or 88-note piano keys
- An overlay of bar lines repeated regularly in time
- An optional frequency axis label in Hertz
- A "soft volume" control to raise the volume above 100%
