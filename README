spettro - Show a moving log-frequency-axis spectrogram of music while it plays

The best spectrogram program on the planet!

All the others give you a linear-frequency-axis spectrogram, which dedicates
the top half of the display to the top octave (10025Hz-22050Hz),
the next quarter of the screen to the penultimate octive and so on,
leaving all the musically useful information crushed into the
bottom centimeter of the graphic.

Spek, foobar2000, sox spectrogram, sndfile-spectrogram, all have linear
frequency axis, leaving you seeing nothing.
Only audacious has a log frequency axis option, but it's blocky.

Spettro is different. It uses a logarithmic frequency axis, which allocates the
same amount of space to each octave, the same as conventional score notation.

Enough ranting.

Spettro plays an audio file and shows a scrolling spectrogram of it
with a vertical green one-pixel-wide line half way across the window to
show the current playing position.

You can also:
- Pause, continue, rewind and seek back and forth in the audio
- Zoom in and out in time in frequency.
- Adjust the dynamic range (a sort of brightness (well, contrast) control
- Change the FFT sample size to adjust the relative frequency/time resolution
- Select from eight different FFT window functions
- Change the colors it uses to represent sound energy
- Show where the ten score lines, six guitar strings or 88 piano keys fall
- Position bar lines to help determine the rhythm and beats-per-bar
- Add a (logarithmic!) frequency axis
- Increase the playing volume above 100%
