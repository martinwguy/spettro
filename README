Spettro shows a scrolling spectrogram of music as it plays.

Most spectrographic music players use a linear frequency axis, which dedicates
the top half of the display to the top octave (10025Hz-22050Hz at CD-quality),
the next quarter of the screen to the penultimate octive and so on,
leaving all the musically interesting information crushed into the
bottom rows of the graphic.

Spettro has a logarithmic frequency axis, which allocates the
same amount of space to each octave, like conventional score notation.

= WHAT IT DOES =

Spettro plays an audio file (WAV, OGG, FLAC and most MP3s) and shows
a scrolling spectrogram of it with a vertical green one-pixel-wide line
half way across the window to show the current playing position.

You can also:
- Pause, continue, rewind and seek back and forth in the audio
- Zoom in and out in time in frequency.
- Adjust the dynamic range (a sort of brightness (well, contrast) control
- Change the FFT sample size to adjust the relative frequency/time resolution
- Select from eight different FFT window functions
- Change the colors it uses to represent sound energy
- Show where the ten score lines, six guitar strings or 88 piano keys fall
- Position bar lines to help determine the rhythm and beats-per-bar
- Add a (logarithmic!) frequency axis
- Increase the playing volume above 100%

There is a screencast of it at https://youtu.be/fGRsLX0Ec1E

It is known to run on GNU/Linux and should be portable to
Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and Tizen.

To get it:
	git clone https://github.com/martinwguy/spettro
	cd spettro
	vi INSTALL

Planned features and improvements are listed in TODO.
Known bugs are listed in BUGS.
