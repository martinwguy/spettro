spettro - Show a moving log-frequency-axis spectrogram of music while it plays

Spettro plays an audio file and shows a scrolling spectrogram of it
with a vertical green one-pixel-wide line half way across the window to
show the current playing position.

You can also:
- Pause, continue, rewind and seek back and forth in the audio
- Zoom in and out in time in frequency.
- Adjust the dynamic range (a sort of brightness (well, contrast) control
- Change the FFT sample size to adjust the relative frequency/time resolution
- Select from eight different FFT window functions
- Change the colors it uses to represent sound energy
- Show where the ten score lines, six guitar strings or 88 piano keys fall
- Position bar lines to help determine the rhythm
- Add a frequency axis
- Increase the playing volume above 100%

There is a screencast of it at https://youtu.be/fGRsLX0Ec1E
