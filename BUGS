When zoomed in on the X axis (i.e. when CPU is at 100%), USE_SDL (SDL_VIDEO)
sometimes leaves fragments of the green line in the spectral columns and
occasionally paints hugs squares of diagonal green-tinted garbage.
It's done this since SDL_VIDEO was implemented in commit ec24.

If the evas_close functions are called on exit, it dumps core.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
With SDL_TIMER zoomed in on X, the CPU load makes it unable to
signal results and the display gets screwed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When zoomed into X axis, Left and Right should move less.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When scrolling screenfuls, it calculates loads of stuff that's
already off-screen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you X-zoom and X-zoom again before it's finished repainting, it dumps core.
