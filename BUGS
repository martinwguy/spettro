If the evas_close functions are called on exit, it dumps core.

With SDL_TIMER zoomed in on X, the CPU load makes it unable to
signal results and the display gets screwed.

SDL keys obtained with AltGr or Shift do not work.

e.g. "Shift +/*" should give * but gives + instead
e.g. "AltGr +/*" should give ] but gives + instead

Very short WAV files play but don't scroll. e.g. spettro monkey.wav (0.2s)

Panning up and down the Y axis doesn't get it quite right.
Most easily seen if you overlay the score lines and pan up/down while playing.
It looks like the screen get scrolled slightly too little.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When max increases, repainted lines are redrawn at new max value.
If scroll_by > 1 this only refreshes every other column at the green line
leaving a mess.  Possibile solutions:
- either remember the max value that each column was interpolated/colored at,
  or, indeed the interpolated/scaled data or color value for the column
  so to that magnitude refresh waits until the column is recalculated
- on scroll_by, repaint scroll_by lines at and to the left of the green line.
