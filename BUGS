When zoomed in on the X axis (i.e. when CPU is at 100%), USE_SDL (SDL_VIDEO)
sometimes leaves fragments of the green line in the spectral columns and
occasionally paints hugs squares of diagonal green-tinted garbage.
It's done this since SDL_VIDEO was implemented in commit ec24.

If the evas_close functions are called on exit, it dumps core.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
With SDL_TIMER zoomed in on X, the CPU load makes it unable to
signal results and the display gets screwed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When zoomed into X axis, Left and Right should move less.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you X-zoom and X-zoom again before it's finished repainting, it dumps core.
[Is this still true?)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It sometimes gets column repaints wrong.

Single-pixel-wide bright or dark stripes appear in the graphic when the
display is scrolling. The bug is sporadic; sometimes two runs will give the
same vertical stripes, other times not, or different.

This may be due to doing too much in the timer interrupt routine.
