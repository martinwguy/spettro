Panning up and down the Y axis doesn't get it quite right.
Most easily seen if you overlay the score lines and pan up/down while playing.
It looks like the screen get scrolled slightly too little.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key-repeat forward scrolling in EMOTION is lumpy.
Strangely, reverse key-repeat scrolling isn't!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
libaudiofile returns half the audio data we asked for followed by half
silence, and the audio fragments it gives us is the requested sample
halved in time and doubled in frequency.

SDL2: SDL always turns numlock off on startup but if it was on, the light
      remains on so its action appears inverted.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
libsox: MP3 decoding via MAD is noisy
This may be because it is seeking to the beginning/end of a frame instead
of to a sample, like libav.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It schedules some columns that are already present.
e.g. spettro 440.wav and press space a few times
e.g. spettro swoop.wav and press ^L
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It calculates duplicate results.
They seem mostly to be columns near the right hand side.
Hypothesis: a calc thread takes a pending column to calculate, removes
the work from the queue, a scroll happens and the same columns
results unrefreshable because there is no work item for it, but there
is no result in the result cache either.
Solution: Keep track of which results are being calculated.

libav seeks to packet boundaries on MP3,FLAC,Ogg
------------------------------------------------------------------------
libav plays AAC and mp4 at one sixth of the speed.

On beppe4, EMOTION doesn't move the spectrogram when playing and consumes
100% processor doing nothing (50% user, 50% system). On ciccio2, which has
the same OS (Debian stretch), it works fine.
SSH-ing from ciccio2 into beppe4 with X11forwarding, it works.
SSH-ing from beppe4 into ciccio2 with X11forwarding, it doesn't work.
Something to do with X or presence/absence of some X extension?
This is using beppe4's crappy on-board SiS VGA controller.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When scrolling up by one pixel, the bottom label disappears
one pixel before it should, probably due to rounding.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When key-repeating a slow operation, the Shift state is measured when
the event is processed, not when the key was pressed. This may be better.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When removing the note-frequency axis, a black line is sometimes left
near the RHS.
Repeat-by: A A Space. or A A Ctrl ->. The black line appears with 10 gray
ones on its right when the scrolling starts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In EMOTION_SDL, the color are inverted!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capital command letters don't work in SDL CACA driver over ssh.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toggle fullscreen key Ctrl-F doesn't work in EFL.
