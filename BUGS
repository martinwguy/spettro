Panning up and down the Y axis doesn't get it quite right.
Most easily seen if you overlay the score lines and pan up/down while playing.
It looks like the screen get scrolled slightly too little.

Key-repeat forward scrolling in EMOTION is lumpy.
Strangely, reverse key-repeat scrolling isn't!

Check fftfreq problems
spettro -f 50		you can move the graphic up but not down again
spettro -f 22050	Funny magindex of -33; Aborted

It calculates duplicate results.
They seem mostly to be columns near the right hand side.
Hypothesis: a calc thread takes a pending column to calculate, removes
the work from the queue, a scroll happens and the same columns
results unrefreshable because there is no work item for it, but there
is no result in the result cache either.
Solution: Keep track of which results are being calculated.
