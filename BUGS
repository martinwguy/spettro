SDL keys obtained with AltGr or Shift do not work.

e.g. "Shift +/*" should give * but gives + instead
e.g. "AltGr +/*" should give ] but gives + instead

This is by design as it is better for games. Try SDL2's TEXTINPUT events.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Panning up and down the Y axis doesn't get it quite right.
Most easily seen if you overlay the score lines and pan up/down while playing.
It looks like the screen get scrolled slightly too little.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key-repeat forward scrolling in EMOTION is lumpy.
Strangely, reverse key-repeat scrolling isn't!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
libaudiofile returns us half the audio data we asked for followed by half
silence, and the audio fragments it gives us is the requested sample
halved in time and doubled in frequency.
